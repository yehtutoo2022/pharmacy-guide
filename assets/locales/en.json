  "about-bmi-p2": "BMI is categorized into several ranges:\nUnderweight: BMI less than 18.5\nNormal weight: BMI 18.5 to 24.9\nOverweight: BMI 25 to 29.9\nObese: BMI 30 or greater",
  "about-bmi-p3": "It's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it has limitations. For example, it doesn't directly measure body fat percentage or distribution of fat. Therefore, it may not be accurate for certain populations such as athletes, individuals with a high muscle mass, or older adults. Additionally, it doesn't take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, or overall body composition.",
  "about-bmi-p4": "Despite its limitations, BMI is widely used in healthcare settings as a simple and quick way to assess potential health risks associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese. However, it's often used in conjunction with other assessments and measurements to provide a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's health status.",

  "about-app-description": "\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are a group of medical conditions that are not caused by infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites and cannot be transmitted from person to person. These diseases typically develop over a long period of time and are often characterized by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Types of NCDs: The most common types of NCDs include:\n* Cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart disease and stroke)\n* Cancer\n* Chronic respiratory diseases (e.g. COPD)\n* Diabetes\n* Obesity\n* Mental health disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety)\n* Musculoskeletal conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis)",

  "hypertension": "Hypertension",
  "hypertension-detail": "Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the arteries. Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps it around the body. It is typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and expressed as two values:\n1. Systolic Blood Pressure: The higher number, representing the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats or contracts (systole).\n2. Diastolic Blood Pressure: The lower number, representing the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest between beats (diastole).\nNormal blood pressure is typically considered to be around 120/80 mm Hg. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure consistently measures at or above 130/80 mm Hg. The severity of hypertension is often categorized into stages:\n1. Stage 1 Hypertension: Blood pressure consistently measures between 130/80 and 139/89 mm Hg.\n2. Stage 2 Hypertension: Blood pressure consistently measures 140/90 mm Hg or higher.\nHypertension is a significant health concern because it can lead to various complications, including:\n1. Cardiovascular problems: High blood pressure can damage the arteries, leading to atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries), which can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other heart-related issues.\n2. Kidney damage: Hypertension can harm the kidneys over time, potentially leading to kidney disease or kidney failure.\n3. Eye problems: It can affect the blood vessels in the eyes, potentially leading to vision problems or even blindness.\n4. Brain issues: Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cognitive decline and vascular dementia.\n5. Other health complications: Hypertension can also contribute to peripheral artery disease, aneurysms, and other health problems.\nThe causes of hypertension can vary and may include factors such as genetics, lifestyle choices (e.g., diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption), obesity, stress, and certain medical conditions. Treatment for hypertension often involves lifestyle modifications, such as adopting a healthy diet, increasing physical activity, and quitting smoking, along with medications prescribed by a healthcare professional. Regular monitoring and management of blood pressure are crucial to reducing the risk of associated health complications.",
  "hypertension-intro":  "In general, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher is considered hypertension.\nHypertension can occur at any age. Elderly people can develop high blood pressure without a cause.\nIn younger people, high blood pressure can be caused by other causes. For example, renal artery disease;\nHormonal gland disease Congenital coronary artery disease and side effects of medications can cause high blood pressure",
